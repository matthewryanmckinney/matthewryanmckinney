- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @matthewryanmckinney. I'm a trained field ecologist, but I really specialize in using GIS and R to solve conservation and species management problems.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in using models and logic to solve problems of the "easier said than done" variety, such finding optimal pest management solutions, when the pest's spatial distribution is dynamic.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to make better use of computers' processing power, through more efficient programming, to find better solutions faster.
